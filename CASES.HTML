SHAH ALAM: Emotions ran high during the inquest into the death of firefighter Muhammad Adib Mohd Kassim as the ninth witness R. Narresh testified that he was saddened by the incident which happened in front of the Sri Maha Mariamman temple in Subang Jaya on Nov 27 last year.
</p>
<p>
Speaking in between sobs, the 30-year-old technician said the attack on Adib was uncalled for as they had come to do their job, which was to rescue people and put out a fire.
</p>
<p>
Narresh said he was also sad that he did not have a chance to meet Adib after the incident, as he had passed away at the National Heart Institute (IJN) a month after the incident.Narresh, who is also a volunteer with the Malaysia Civil Defence Force (APM), was the one who helped Adib by taking him to the Subang Jaya Medical Centre (SJMC) after the incident.
</p>
<p>
“If we had left him (Adib) unattended by the roadside, I do not think he could have made it to the hospital or survived another month,” he said to a question by Adib’s family lawyer <b>Ahmad Taufiq Baharum.</b>
